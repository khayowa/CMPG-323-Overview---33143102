## Branching Strategy
The Feature Branching Strategy is the approach that will be taken throughout the development and maintenance cycle. This will consist of a main branch which will be protected and a develop branch which will be default. For any feature addition, a feature branch will be created and merged with the develop branch. After all the necessary features are merged to the develop branch, a pull request to the main branch will be submitted to add all the features from the develop branch at once. A hotfix branch will modify the main branch directly and the develop branch to keep correlation between main and develop.

## Use of a .gitignore file
A .gitignore file is used to ignore a chosen file or folder. In API development which is project 2, a .gitignore file is highly required to allow builds to come from one source. This is essential as during development, modifications or debbuging applies on the same feauture. Web app project testing patterns, project 3 and RPA and testing project, project 4 will also require a .gitignore file as this will help avoid potentially costly commits of files that should be versioned during testing.
